## Quickstart

```
docker run -it --rm bytesmith/mlserver
```

### Start Revo64

Run the Revo64 program. By default, Revo64 is installed in the /usr/bin directory:

1. From /Home or any other working directory:
    ```
    [<path>] $ Revo64
    ```

2. Run a RevoScaleR function, such as rxSummary on a dataset. Many sample datasets, such as the iris dataset, are ready to use because they are installed with the software:
    ```
    rxSummary(~., iris)
    ```

Output from the iris dataset should look similar to the following:

```
Rows Read: 150, Total Rows Processed: 150, Total Chunk Time: 0.001 seconds
Computation time: 0.005 seconds.
Call:
rxSummary(formula = ~., data = iris)

Summary Statistics Results for: ~.
Data: iris
Number of valid observations: 150

    Name         Mean     StdDev    Min Max ValidObs MissingObs
    Sepal.Length 5.843333 0.8280661 4.3 7.9 150      0
    Sepal.Width  3.057333 0.4358663 2.0 4.4 150      0
    Petal.Length 3.758000 1.7652982 1.0 6.9 150      0
    Petal.Width  1.199333 0.7622377 0.1 2.5 150      0

Category Counts for Species
Number of categories: 3
Number of valid observations: 150
Number of missing observations: 0

    Species    Counts
    setosa     50
    versicolor 50
    virginica  50
```

To quit the program, type *q()* at the command line with no arguments.

### Start Python

1. From /Home or any other working directory:
    ```
    [<path>] $ mlserver-python
    ```

2. Run a revoscalepy function, such as rx_Summary on a dataset. Many sample datasets are built in. At the Python command prompt, paste the following script:
    ```
    import os
    import revoscalepy 

    sample_data_path = revoscalepy.RxOptions.get_option("sampleDataDir")
    ds = revoscalepy.RxXdfData(os.path.join(sample_data_path, "AirlineDemoSmall.xdf"))

    summary = revoscalepy.rx_summary("ArrDelay+DayOfWeek", ds) 

    print(summary)
    ```

Output from the sample dataset should look similar to the following:

```
Summary Statistics Results for: ArrDelay+DayOfWeek
File name: /opt/microsoft/mlserver/9.3.0/libraries/PythonServer/revoscalepy/data/sample_data/AirlineDemoSmall.xdf
Number of valid observations: 600000.0

       Name       Mean     StdDev   Min     Max  ValidObs  MissingObs
0  ArrDelay  11.317935  40.688536 -86.0  1490.0  582628.0     17372.0

Category Counts for DayOfWeek
Number of categories: 7

            Counts

1          97975.0
2          77725.0
3          78875.0

```

To quit the program, type *quit()* at the command line with no arguments.
